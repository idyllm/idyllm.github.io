# Building Blocks

Engineering notes for useful sub-circuits.

### [Linear voltage to exponential current](./lin2exp.md)

Convert a linear control voltage to an exponential current (e.g. V/oct). This circuit is a key building block for VCOs, VCFs, etc.

### Pulse Generators

Generate short pulses from rising and falling edges of gate signals.

### Buffers

Create clean logic transitions or reduce output impedance.

### LED Drivers

Transistor-based circuits to add LEDs as visual signal indicators.
