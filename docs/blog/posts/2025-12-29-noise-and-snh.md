# More Modules

Taking advantage of some free time during the holiday, I've ported over the docs for another pair of modules that I built and installed a while ago: [Random Noise](../../projects/noise/index.md) and the ['398 SNH](../../projects/sample-and-hold/index.md). 

<!-- more -->

These are both mostly direct implementations of existing designs. The noise source is based on the [MFOS Noise Cornucopia](https://musicfromouterspace.com/analogsynth_new/NOISECORNREV01/NOISECORNREV01.php) and the sample and hold is based on [Rene Schmitz's YASH](https://schmitzbits.de/sah.html). Both came togther without a fuss, but I did spend some time on filter design for both - details are on the project pages.
