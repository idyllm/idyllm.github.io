# Updated Gate Delay

After getting the PCBs back for the first version of the gate delay, I decided that there were two features I missed: split controls (CV and pot) for the delay itself and a trigger (short pulse) output. 

<!-- more -->

Rather than continuing to try and cram two delays into one module, it was easiest to drop one and use the extra space to accomodate the new input and ouput. With this iteration, I also put together a faceplace design, so I now have another "production" module in the rack. 

Next up is the ADSR EG.
