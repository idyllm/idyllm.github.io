Welcome.

This site exists to keep track of my projects and share those designs. This is an effort built on a foundation laid by many talented and generous people to whom I am grateful.

Look in the [Projects](../projects/index.md) section for module designs, including schematics, PCB layouts, BOM, firmware, technical notes and assembly instructions. Each project lives in a self-contained repository with its own documentation. I primarily use [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org) for schematics and layout.

The [References](../references/index.md) section is a collection of guides for common design and build information, including part sourcing and mechanical details. Links to other useful resources are also collected there.
